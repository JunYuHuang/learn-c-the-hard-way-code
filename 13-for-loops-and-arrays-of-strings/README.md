# Exercise 13: For-Loops and Arrays of Strings

## Notes

- comma operator: see the [Wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma_operator)

## Extra Credit

- [ ] ~~Figure out what kind of code you can put into the parts of a `for-loop`.~~
  - Skipped
- [x] Look up how to use the comma character (,) to separate multiple statements in the parts of the `for-loop`, but between the semicolon characters (;).
  - See `ex13_modded.c`
- [x] Read what a `NULL` is and try to use it in one of the elements from the `states` array to see what it'll print.
  - `NULL` is a special value that means zero, nothing or an empty container
  - it prints `(null)`
  - See `ex13_modded.c`
- [x] See if you can assign an element from the `states` array to the `argv` array before printing both. Try the inverse.
  - See `ex13_modded.c`
