# Exercise 9: Whie-Loop and Boolean Expressions

## Notes

- not initializing a declared int variable in C
  - most compilers set a default value of 0 but this is not reliable
- always initialise variables

## Extra Credit

- [x] Make the loop count backward by using `i--` to start at 25 and go to 0.
  - See `ex9-modded.c`
- [x] Write a few more complex `while-loops` using what you know so far.
  - See `ex9-modded.c`
