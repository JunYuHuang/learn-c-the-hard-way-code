# Exercise 34: Dynamic Array

## Notes

- TODO

## Extra Credit

- [ ] 1. Improve the unit tests to cover more of the operations, and test them using a for-loop to ensure that they work.
  - TODO
- [ ] 2. Research what it would take to implement bubble sort and merge sort for DArray, but don't do it yet. I'll be implementing DArray algorithms next, so you'll do this then.
  - TODO
- [ ] 3. Write some performance tests for common operations and compare them to the same operations in `List`. You did some of this already, but this time, write a unit test that repeatedly does the operation in question, and then in the main runner, do the timing.
  - TODO
- [ ] 4. Look at how the `DArray_expand` is implemented using a constant increase (size + 300). Typically, dynamic arrays are implemented with a multiplicative increase (size \* 2), but I've found this to cost needless memory for no real performance gain. Test my assertion and see when you'd want a multiplicative increase instead of a constant increase.
