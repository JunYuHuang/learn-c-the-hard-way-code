  - [x] get the copy-pasted source code to compile and build
  - [x] type-copy the source code into `./modded`
  - [ ] add code comments to `./modded`
  - [ ] read text and add notes here

## Extra Credit

- [ ] ~~1. Implement a `TSTree_collect` that returns a `DArray` containing all of the keys that match the given prefix.~~
  - Skipped
- [ ] ~~2. Implement `TSTree_search_suffix` and a `TSTree_insert_suffix` so you can do suffix searches and inserts.~~
  - Skipped
- [ ] ~~3. Use the debugger to see how this structure is used in memory compared to the `BSTree` and `Hashmap`.~~
