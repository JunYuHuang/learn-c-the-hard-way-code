# `devpkg` README

`devpkg` is a toy CLI tool for installing software packages from a URL under the `/tmp/` directory.

For this to work, `devpkg` assumes the following:

- `devpkg` will be used on a UNIX or Linux based OS.
- The package URL contains the source code compressed as a `.tar.gz` or `.tar.bz2` file.
- The package supports the following shell commands:
  - `./configure`
  - `make`
  - `make install`

- [How To Use](#how-to-use)
- [Appendix A: Set Up Prereqs](#appendix-a-set-up-prereqs)
- [Appendix B: Test `devpkg`](#appendix-b-test-devpkg)

## Prerequisites

`devpkg` assumes the following before installation:

- Apache Portable Runtime (`apr`) 1.5.2 is installed
- Apache Portable Runtime Utility Library (`apr-util`) 1.5.4 is installed

The above versions of `apr` and `apr-util` may be installed and configured by following the steps in [Appendix A](#appendix-a-set-up-prereqs).

## How To Install (From Source Code)

```bash
# Go to the project directory root
cd devpkg

# Compile the source code
make

# Install / copy the binary under `/usr/local/bin`
make install

# Optional: Remove the built binary and object files
make clean
```

## How To Use

`devpkg` supports the following 5 commands:

- [Setup](#how-to-use---setup)
- [Install](#how-to-use---install)
- [List](#how-to-use---list)
- [Fetch](#how-to-use---fetch)
- [Build](#how-to-use---build)

Note that most if not all commands need superuser privileges i.e. they must be prefixed with `sudo ` before running them.

### How To Use - Setup

Sets up a new installation on a computer.
Must be done once before using any other commands.

```bash
devpkg -S
```

### How To Use - Install

Installs a piece of software from a URL.

```bash
# Syntax
devpkg -I <URL>

# Example usage
devpkg -I https://dlcdn.apache.org/httpd/httpd-2.4.59.tar.gz
```

### How To Use - List

Lists all software installed using `devpkg`.

```bash
devpkg -L
```

### How To Use - Fetch

Downloads source code from a URL for manual building.

```bash
# Syntax
devpkg -F <URL>

# Example usage
devpkg -F https://dlcdn.apache.org/httpd/httpd-2.4.59.tar.gz
```

### How To Use - Build

Builds the source code and installs it, even if it is already installed.

```bash
# Syntax
devpkg -B <URL>

# Example usage
devpkg -B https://dlcdn.apache.org/httpd/httpd-2.4.59.tar.gz
```

## Appendix A: Set Up Prereqs

1. [Install `apr` and `apr-util`](#install-apr-and-apr-util)
2. [Configure `apr` and `apr-util`](#configure-apr-and-apr-util)

### Install `apr` and `apr-util`

Run the following shell script as a superuser to install `apr` and `apr-util`:

```bash
set -e

# go somewhere safe
cd /tmp

# get the source to base APR 1.5.2
curl -L -O http://archive.apache.org/dist/apr/apr-1.5.2.tar.gz

# extract it and go into the source
tar -xzvf apr-1.5.2.tar.gz
cd apr-1.5.2

# you need this on OSX Yosemite
touch libtoolT

# configure, make, make install
./configure
make
sudo make install

# reset and cleanup
cd /tmp
rm -rf apr-1.5.2 apr-1.5.2.tar.gz

# do the same with apr-util
curl -L -O http://archive.apache.org/dist/apr/apr-util-1.5.4.tar.gz

# extract
tar -xzvf apr-util-1.5.4.tar.gz
cd apr-util-1.5.4

# you need this on OSX Yosemite
touch libtoolT

# configure, make, make install
./configure --with-apr=/usr/local/apr
# you need that extra parameter to configure because
# apr-util can't really find it because...who knows.

make
sudo make install

# cleanup
cd /tmp
rm -rf apr-util-1.5.4* apr-1.5.2*
```

### Configure `apr` and `apr-util`

Note that the following steps need superuser privileges.

1. Under `/etc/ld.conf.so.d`, create the file `apr.conf` with the following content:

```
/usr/local/apr/lib
```

2. Run `sudo ldconfig`.

## Appendix B: Test `devpkg`

This test script assumes `devpkg`'s [How To Install (From Source Code)](#how-to-install-from-source-code) have been followed.

Run `sudo sh test.sh` to test all of `devpkg`'s commands.
