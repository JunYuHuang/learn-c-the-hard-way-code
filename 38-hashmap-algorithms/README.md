# Exercise 38: Hashmap Algorithms

## Notes

- TODOs
  - watch video
  - read and takes notes from text reading

## Extra Credit

- [ ] ~~1. Take the `default_hash` out of the `hashmap.c`, make it one of the algorithms in `hashmap_algos.c`, and then make all of the tests work again.~~
  - Skipped
- [ ] ~~2. Add the `default_hash` to the `hashmap_algos_tests.c` test and compare its statistics to the other hash functions.~~
  - Skipped
- [ ] ~~3. Find a few more hash functions and add them, too. You can never have too many hash functions!~~
  - Skipped
