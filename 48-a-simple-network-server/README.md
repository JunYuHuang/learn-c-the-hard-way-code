## `statserve` Specs

The specification for this project is very simple:

- [ ] 1. Create a simple network server that accepts a connection on port 7899 from `netclient` or the `nc` command, and echoes back anything you type.
- [ ] 2. You'll need to learn how to bind a port, listen on the socket, and answer it. Use your research skills to study how this is done and attempt to implement it yourself.
- [ ] 3. The more important part of this project is laying out the project directory from the `c-skeleton`, and making sure you can build everything and get it working.
- [ ] 4. Don't worry about things like daemons or anything else. Your server just has to run from the command line and keep running.
