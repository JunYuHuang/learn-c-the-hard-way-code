## Extra Credit

- [ ] 1. Research the `Hashmap` implementation in your favorite programming language to see what features it has.
  - TODO
- [ ] 2. Find out what the major disadvantages of a `Hashmap` are and how to avoid them. For example, it doesn't preserve order without special changes, nor does it work when you need to find things based on parts of keys.
  - TODO
- [ ] 3. Write a unit test that demonstrates the defect of filling a `Hashmap` with keys that land in the same bucket, then test how this impacts performance. A good way to do this is to just reduce the number of buckets to something stupid, like five.
