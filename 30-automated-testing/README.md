## Notes

- TODO

## Extra Credit

- [ ] 1. This works but it's probably a bit messy. Clean the `c-skeleton` directory up so that it has all of these files, but remove any of the code related to Exercise 29. You should be able to copy this directory over and kick-start new projects without much editing.

- [ ] 2. Study the `runtests.sh`, and then go read about `bash` syntax so you know what it does. Do you think you could write a C version of this script?
