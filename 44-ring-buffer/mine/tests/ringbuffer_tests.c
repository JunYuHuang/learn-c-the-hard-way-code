/*
For your unit test, you'll want to test as many possible conditions
as you can. The easiest way to do that is to preconstruct different
`RingBuffer` structs, and then manually check that the functions and
math work right. For example, you could make one where `end` is
right at the end of the buffer and `start` is right before the
buffer, and then see how it fails.
