# Exercise 44: Ring Buffer

## Notes

- ring buffer
  - a queue variant
- todos
  - [x] type-copy the source code into `./mine`
  - [x] add code comments to `./mine`
  - [ ] write my own `ringbuffer_tests.c`
  - [ ] read text and add notes here
  - [ ] watch video and add notes here

## Extra Credit

- [ ] ~~1. Create an alternative implementation of `RingBuffer` that uses the POSIX trick and a unit test for it.~~
  - Skipped
- [ ] ~~2. Add a performance comparison test to this unit test that compares the two versions by fuzzing them with random data and random read/write operations. Make sure that you set up this fuzzing so that the same operations are done to each version, and you can compare them between runs.~~
