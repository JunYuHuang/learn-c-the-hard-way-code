# Exercise 39: Binary Search Trees

## Notes

- TODO
- todos
  - [x] get copy and pasted code compiled and running
  - [x] type-copy the code to `./modded`
  - [ ] add code comments to `./modded`
    - WIP: continue from code comments on `bstree.c:199-205`

## Extra Credit

- [ ] ~~1. There's an alternative way to do this data structure without using recursion. The Wikipedia page shows alternatives that don't use recursion but do the same thing. Why would this be better or worse?~~
  - Skipped
- [ ] ~~2. Read up on all of the different but similar trees you can find. There are AVL trees (named after Georgy Adelson-Velsky and E.M. Landis), red-black trees, and some non-tree structures like skip lists.~~
